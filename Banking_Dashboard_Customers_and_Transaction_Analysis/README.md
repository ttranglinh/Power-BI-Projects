# Banking Dashboard: Customers & Transaction Analysis
## 1. Business context
- Taking on a role as a Bank Data Analyst, I analyse 20k+ records of financial transactions to understand customer behaviour, optimize services, and inform strategic planning.
- The goal is to **build a dashboard that extracts patterns, segment behaviours, and revenue drivers** that banks use to:
  - Improve personalization
  - Assess customer risk and profitability
  - Refine marketing campaigns
  - Optimize branch and channel performance
